<h1>Knee3D - Part C Masters Project at the University of Oxford, 2024-2025</h1>

This project is in partnership with the OxMedIs Research group, and clincians at the John Radciffe Hospital. Data is courtesy of the public Osteoarthiritis Initiative Dataset. </p>

It is foucsing on building software to aid the preoperative planning and inoperative procedures of a knee osteotomy. <br>
This is a surgery in which a wedge is cut out of the tibia or femur in order to correct bowed or knocked knees. <br>
</p>

As an initial goal, we have coded angleViewer, which allows the user to view reconstructed MRI slices of the knee from ANY angle, given only saggital view slices. Change the attribute "theta" in the python file to specify the desired angle in radians. <br>
This feature allows clinicians to find the angle which correctly alligns the keen cap over the knee, before making the cut into the bone. Currently, this is achieved by trial and error x-raying.
Some preliminary examples are below, with the knee cap and fibula overlayed onto a slice of the knee at different angles.
